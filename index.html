        <h1>Visualizing African American Social Mobility In The US In The Past 100 Years</h1>
        <p>This website will help users visualize trends of indicators of African American social mobility in the US in the last 100 years. 
            The data was downloaded and scraped from IPUMS US, which is a website and database providing access to over sixty integrated, 
            high-precision samples of the American population drawn from federal censuses. The data was then processed through R code in 
            Rstudio and used to create the visualizations below. Note that all the data below only shows adults from ages 25-64 and data 
            was used starting from roughly 100 years ago to the present time.

        <p>Some of the key indicators used in this project to indicate social mobility included socioeconomic status, income, and education
            level. These three key indicators were quantitatively specified by SEI, OCCSCORE, and EDUC from IPUMS US. SEI or the 
            Duncan Socioeconmic Index is a score assigned to each occupation using the 1950 occupational classification scheme available in the OCC1950
            variable, and is a measure of occupational status based upon the income level and educational attainment associated with each occupation in
            1950. OCCSCORE was measured by assigning each occuptation a value representing the median total income, in hundreds of 1950s dollars, of all
            people in that occupation in 1950. EDUC was measured by a number from 00 to 11 where the number corresponded to roughly the level of 
            education of an individual, where 00 represents no schooling and 11 represents 5+ years of college.

        <p>The mean occupational income score for White Americans and Black Americans for the past 100 years follow a shockingly similar upward pattern, as if the trend for White Americans were shifted down around 3 to 4 points it would almost exactly match the trend for Black Americans. This suggests that the difference in social mobility between White Americans and Black Americans remained relatively constant throughout the last 100 years, but both showed an overall upward progression.

Interestingly enough, there was a dip in the graph from 1940 to 1950 for both White and Black Americans, perhaps due to the second world war, but soon both graphs followed an upward trend again. Excluding the strange dip in 1950, the overall difference in educational attainment decreased over the past 100 years.

        <h2>Takeaways And Considerations</h2>
        <p>Overall, based on the data and graphs, it seems like African American social mobility has improved over the past 100 years.
           Moreover, the gender gap between African American men and women has decreased significantly. However, there is still a significant 
           disparity between Black Americans and their White American counterparts.

           The entirety of this project was based on the IPUMS US database, where the OCCSCORE, SEI, and EDUC variables came from the work
           of Otis Duncan based on NORC's 1947 North-Hatt study and the 1950 US Census. It is important to acknowledge the
           of the limitations of these numbers and graphs, as they don't explain why the trends are happening, and don't explain the full picture.
           However, what these numbers and graphs do provide is one way of showing the changes in social mobility of African Americans in the US in 
           the last 100 years through indicators such as mean occupational income score, Duncan socioeconomic status, and educational attainment.
